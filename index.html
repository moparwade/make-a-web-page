      <li><b>What is a Webpage</b>
        <p>
           A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML (<em>HyperText Markup Language</em>). Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
        </p>  
      <li><b>How Coding Works</b>
        <p>
           Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text...<br>
           <span>like this</span>:<br>
          I'm &lt;b>learning&lt;b> to code!<br>
           <span>look like this</span>:<br>  
          I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
        </p>  
      <li><b>Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b>
        <p>
          There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
        </p>  
      <li><b>Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
        <p>
        <ul><li><em>Tag</em>: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (&lt;p> for example) and a closing tag, (&lt;/p>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the &lt;br> tag).<br>
            <li><em>Element</em>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
            <li><em>Attribute</em>: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write &lt;a href="www.udacity.com">
        </ul>
      </ul>

  <h2 id="lesson-2">HTML with Structure</h2>
  <div>
  <div class="content">
    <ul>
      <li><b>HTML controls the "structure" of a website</b>
        <p>
       HTML elements are either inline or block.<br> Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
        </p>
      <li><b>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</b>
        <p>
       CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).<br> CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
        </p>
      <li><b>DOM - Document Object Model</b>
        <p>
       A cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages).<br> The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
        </p>
    </ul>
  </div>    
  </div>
  <h2 id="lesson-3">Styling with CSS</h2>
    <div>
      <div class="content">
        <ul>
          <li><b>CSS properties</b>
            <p>
            CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.<br> This separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods.
            </p>
          <li><b>Inheritance</b>
            <p>
            Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.<br> Inheritance prevents certain properties from being declared over and over again in a style sheet, allowing the software developers to write less CSS.<br> It enhances faster-loading of web pages by users and enables the clients to save money on bandwidth and development costs.</p>
          <li><b>Avoid Repetition</b>
            <p>
            Avoiding repetition is important to avoid errors. If you are writing the same code over and over it is very easy to make errors.<br> If then you want to change the code, every line of repetition must be changed to avoid problems.<br> Avoiding repetition is also important to maintain consistency when you are adding style elements.
